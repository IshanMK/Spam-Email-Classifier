# Spam Email Classifier using GradientBoostingClassifier

This repository is dedicated to a spam email classifier developed using GradientBoostingClassifier from scikit-learn. The classifier is trained on a labeled dataset of emails, utilizing NLP techniques for feature extraction and supervised learning for classification. Key features include:

- **GradientBoostingClassifier Implementation**: Implementation of GradientBoostingClassifier for training and predicting spam or legitimate (ham) emails.
- **Dataset Preparation**: Scripts for preprocessing the email dataset, including tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, and feature engineering.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation scripts to assess classifier performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Continuous Development**: Ongoing development to enhance model accuracy, optimize parameters, and explore additional features for improved classification.
- **Deployment Guide**: Documentation and scripts for deploying the model in production environments or integrating it into email services.

This project aims to provide a robust solution for detecting spam emails effectively, leveraging GradientBoostingClassifier for high-performance classification.
